## Work Transit   

This project is meant to collect travel times between work, home and a few other destinations. 




## Background   

I am a data scientist who lives in the Northern Bronx and will have to commute to the lower west side (meat packing district) soon. While I am very excited to meet my coworkers and see the (brand) new office space, I am worried about my commute. I know it will be long but I am trying to find the latest/optimal time to leave. I am still deciding on whether to take the public transit or drive to work. This project aims to help me collect data on the time it take to travel to work.   


The final decision will probably not completely rely on this data as there are many other factors. 
1. I recently adopted a dog and will be taking him to work. I am not sure how well the dog will do on the subway 
2. Driving for an hour into and out of the city (during rush hour traffic) can be stressful which I may try to avoid 
3. Parking in the city is expensive 
4. Driving into the city hopefully take much less time than public transit.
